description: One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

Accommodates to attrition and degradation

Corrosion and contamination makes its expression richer

To everything there is a season

Truth comes from the observation of nature

Greatness exists in the inconspicuous and overlooked details

The beauty of things imperfect

All things are incomplete

The suggestion of natural processes. Things wabi-sabi are made of materials that are visibly vulnerable to the effects of weathering and human treatment. They record the sun, wind, rain, heat, and cold in a language of discoloration, rust, tarnish, stain, warping, shrinking, shriveling, and cracking. Their nicks, chips, bruises, scars, dents, peeling, and other forms of attrition are a testament to histories of use and misuse.
