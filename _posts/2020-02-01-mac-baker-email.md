description: How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.

*TL;DR*: The ideal interface is your Mom. She doesn't need to show you a chart, she just needs to say 'You're tired, you need to go to bed.' You do it because you trust her and you know she's right. Charts are fun and pretty, but only a persuasion stopgap or a presentation aid to help you understand. Digging into data is a fleeting joy. Using a chart to illustrate a correlation can be helpful. Make it Pertinent, Pretty, Polite, and Protected.

> ... unless I'm wrong, you were creative director for Basis for 2 years!?
That product has been one of my biggest inspirations for this project by far.

That's very nice to hear. Correct, I co-founded Basis in 2010 and served as Creative Director until last year.

> (1) Did having all those unique data streams like heart rate, perspiration, and skin temperature reveal anything about users that you didn't expect? or more interestingly, that you may not have designed for until you saw it?
The largest advantage of having multiple data streams was correlation and coverage overlap. The mixture of sensors were selected for their complementary benefits (i.e Synergy: improving the effectiveness of each sensor by correlating data with other sensors). However, we were most concerned with ensuring continuous coverage. Every sensor has its own operating conditions required to report accurately. They all fail, sometimes horribly, in certain cases. But the combination ensures continuous collection.

The most unexpected possibilities relate to detecting and acting upon Affective states. It's great to know how many steps you took today, but that becomes infinitely more meaningful if you can connect this to how I feel. Lots of services allow you to do light reporting of mood (i.e. Nike Fuel, Dailymile support emoticons to report sentiment). But these are biased, reflective, self reported, and non-continuous.

The correlations between mental activity, emotional state, and physiological arousal are surprisingly regular and detectable. These were the surprises. Monitoring the right combination of metrics, with sufficient accuracy and regularity, allows you to infer emotional state. Monitoring activity allows you to infer causation.

This introduces the possibility to look at a graph, identify when I felt angry, what (or who) might have caused this, and most importantly how I can change it. This is biggest insight I might offer: How does our relationship with technology change when it's possible for machines to understand the Human Experience; intent, not just action?

> (2) Did giving users access to the "raw" chart data empower them to see insights you might not have caught and/or caused them to take any actions based on their own analysis? Or was it more for peace of mind and curiosity?

> (3) Did users find the direct suggestions for changes to their habits really useful and/or take action on them?

> (4) Where do you draw the line for what should and should't be "designed" in the system? Is personal analysis of even things as simple as small trend-graphs or pie charts something that the average user actually does? Or is it just the passionate 1%?
Blanket, lump response.

The product designs and functionality went through many, many iterations. Some included tools far richer than the more recent version of the site. However, we found that users quickly lost interest, unable to see the 'so what.' Other versions included simplified visuals with no ability to inspect the data behind it. Users lost interest in these as too simplistic, unable to see the 'now what'. Ultimately, we found that in order to extend beyond the early adopters, you have to make meaning, show your work,/and/ recommend next steps.

*Here's the what, how, so what, now what.*

Humans are naturally suspicious of new information, especially information that contradicts beliefs, tremendously so when these suggestions come from machines. Showing our work, how we came to those conclusions, increased user's trust in the system. However, the most effective prototypes used social proof.

'You'll feel better if you run at night' causes skepticism.

'See, heres the data' lowers skepticism slightly.

'It works, just ask your friend Tom' virtually eliminates skepticism.

Social proof wins. In many cases, with zero supporting data.

While I can't delve deeply into the details, these suggestions for 'life optimization' are the primary focus of further development at Basis as well as throughout the wearable space. Everyone is excited by the 'Quantified Self' movement, but most are really interested in the 'Qualified Self' (whether they know it or not). In other words, lots of folks think it's neat to track steps. But they have unspoken intentions about how this information might help them. Only geeks find interest in the pure data. Everyone wants to jump past the 'got data' to the 'made it meaningful.'
