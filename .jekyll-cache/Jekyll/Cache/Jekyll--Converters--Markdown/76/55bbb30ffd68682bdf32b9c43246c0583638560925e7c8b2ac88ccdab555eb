I"Š<p>When people hear the word â€œdesignâ€, they think â€œspecialâ€; creating â€œspecialâ€ things is what everyone, designers and users alike, assume design is all about. When in fact, both sides are playing out a mutual fantasy far removed from real life.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like us to explore whatever we might conceive as Super Normal. Itâ€™s much more of a quietly seen unseen, a refreshing surprise that awakens the person who had thought of looking for something obviously special in design by instead reconfirming what we already hold important and so perhaps letting us break free of our current design paradigm straight jacket.</p>

<p>Special is generally less useful than normal, and less rewarding in the long term. Special things demand attention for the wrong reasons, interrupting potentially good atmosphere with their awkward presence.</p>
