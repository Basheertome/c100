I"<p>I ought to just try that with my boss; Iâ€™d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didnâ€™t have my parents to think about Iâ€™d have given in my notice a long time ago, Iâ€™d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. Heâ€™d fall right off his desk!</p>
