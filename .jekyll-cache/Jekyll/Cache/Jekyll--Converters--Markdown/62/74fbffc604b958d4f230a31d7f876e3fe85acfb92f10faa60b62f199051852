<p>Food sits in the blurry foreground of most of our lives’ important moments. It’s unavoidable – food is art, medicine, sustenance, comfort, &amp; community. And yet, it has often been an unpredictable and scary experience dealing with the tools that make it, discouraging people from engaging more deeply with the fuel of their daily lives.</p>

<p>We’re on the cusp of a new era. More than ever, people care about what they eat, where it’s from, and <em>how it’s made</em>.</p>

<p>The kitchen is the new tool shed.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Started in 2020, C100 is a monthly digital journal about the tools we use in the kitchen through the lens of design and technology. It’s for this new age of makers, explorers, and creatives who understand that technology is powered by style, taste and story, not just by technology alone.</p>
