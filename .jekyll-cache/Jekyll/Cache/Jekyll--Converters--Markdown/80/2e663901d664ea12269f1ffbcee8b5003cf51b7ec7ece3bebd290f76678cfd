<p>Beyond Automation: Machine Learning as a Creative Tool</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Half a decade into the explosion of machine learning and pretty much everyone has heard of it; itâ€™s the Next Big Thing. But the way most buzzword enthusiasts talk about it &amp; approach it, machine learning so far has only taken the human further out of the equation. But what if it could be so much more participatory?</p>

<p>As an abstraction layer, machine learning has the power to fundamentally change how we interact with our computers. This will enable more dynamic &amp; natural expression, new mediums, and entirely new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>In this talk, Iâ€™ll walk through that reasoning, show you other artists, designers, scientists, &amp; engineersâ€™ work already pushing this thought further, and show you the tools Iâ€™ve found that will let you start experimenting on your own to incorporate these ideas into your own practice directly.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Convince creative people that machine learning can be a truly powerful creative tool, rather than just an eye-roll-inducing buzzword topic.</p>
