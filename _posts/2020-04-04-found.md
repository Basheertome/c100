    > Acidity comes in many delicious forms. Much of the research performed here at the Lab concerns our unending search for them, from our exploration of sour wild things to our investigations of the possibilities of lactic and acetic acid fermentations. Acids can balance [flavours](http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2015/8/6/cooking-with-alkali), providing brightness and cutting through richness, or they can make you pucker your lips in a delight bordering on pain. But what about their chemical opposites, the alkalis?

    Lovely overview from the folks at Noma, going fairly deep into the science without losing sight of the practical culinary implications.

    > Acids are invaluable mainstay cooking ingredients. Lemon and lime juices, myriad vinegars and sour salt, or citric acid, can brighten and balance the flavor of almost any food. But what about their chemical opposites, the un-acids? These are the alkalis, and they’re a different story.

    This short, old, but still relevant article in the NYT by culinary legend Harold McGee really opened my eyes to the full palate that pH’s spectrum encompasses, tying it right back to pretzels in a clear way.
