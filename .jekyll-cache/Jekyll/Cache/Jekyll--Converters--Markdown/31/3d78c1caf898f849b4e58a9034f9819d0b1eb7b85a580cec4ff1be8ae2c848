<h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
<p>Stick to Slow-Carb Diet approved foods 6 days a week: lean meat, beans, and veggies and no white foods like sugar, pasta, rice, bread, cheese.</p>

<p>Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You probably do this already; you’re just picking new default meals.</p>

<p>Don’t drink calories. 1-2 glasses of red wine is okay.</p>

<p>Start your day with protein, shooting for 30g within 30 minutes of waking (boosts success rate by 11%).</p>

<p>Don’t eat fruit. Tomatoes and avocados are allowed in moderation.</p>

<p>Take one “cheat day” a week: Eat whatever you want on cheat days. Tim recommends Saturday for social purposes.</p>

<h1 id="breakfast">Breakfast</h1>
<p>The ideal breakfast is 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. Eggs are an easy way to do this (and boost success rate by 10%). Some meal ideas:</p>

<p>Smoothie with 30g of protein powder</p>

<p>3 eggs (16g) with 3 slices of Canadian bacon (13g)</p>

<p>2 eggs (12g) with 1/2 cup black beans (20g), salsa and guacamole</p>

<p>3 servings of spinach or broccoli frittata (30g or
5-6 eggs plus some protein from the veggies)</p>

<p>Caffeine is okay! Drink unsweetened coffee or tea without milk or cream. If you drink caffeinated soda in the morning, limit it to one can of diet soda a day.</p>
