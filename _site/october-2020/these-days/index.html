  <p>The first time he’d come to this Ikea had been on a weekend, when the place was packed with middle-class families and newlyweds and college students with their parents. Many of the shoppers, like Connor, had just moved to the city, and they looked anxious and overwhelmed, walking around with yellow recycled plastic shopping bags and strips of paper measuring tape and little golf pencils, trying to figure out how an oak dinette set or a $299 sofa would fit into their new lives.</p>

<p>“We all just want to prove we’re special, different. It’s like how everyone on Facebook tries to come up with their own way of wishing you happy birthday.”</p>

<p>Today, the cafeteria was nowhere near as crowded as it had been that first weekend. Connor and K pulled slightly wet trays from…</p>

<p>“And that, in essence, brings us to the paradox of Gen Y. They want to stay connected but they want to get away. They want the freedom to choose but are drowning in choices. They love and embrace technology but yearn for simpler modes of life. They spend exorbitant amounts of time in cyberspace yet crave genuine face-to-face experiences. But it’s important to note that the majority of them don’t see these opposites as mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Before he moved to New York, Connor never gave much thought to what lay on the insides of city blocks. He assumed they were solid building—brick, wood, and glass running from facade to facade. It didn’t take long for his mental image of them to change, for the city blocks to get hollowed out, their solid interiors replaced by restaurant ventilation units, ground-floor patios, and the occasional backyard and solitary tree.</p>

<p>“I’m not available right now,” her recorded voice said. “But answer this question after the beep and I might be inclined to call you back. If you could instantly learn any new language, what language would that be?” There was a long beep. “Hi, it’s Connor, the devastatingly handsome guy you met at Ikea,” he said. “And if I could instantly learn a new language, it would have to be sign language. I would learn sign lang—” There was a click on the other end, and a voice said, “Hello?” Connor stopped for a moment. He had forgotten how answering machines worked. “Oh,” he said. “Hi.” “Why sign language?” she asked. “Because I was listening to this science podcast and they were talking about how language plays a huge role in shaping the way we think,” he said. “I figure maybe learning a more visual language might make me a more visual thinker. Braille would be pretty cool too.” “Good answer.” “Thank you. What do I win?” “Sign language. You win sign language. By the power vested in me by the Polish mystics of the neighborhood of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, I hereby grant you the ability to sign.” “Wow, it worked!” She giggled. “It did?” “Yeah. Here, I’m signing something to you right now.” He pulled the phone away from his face for a few seconds. “Did you get it?” “I missed it. What’d you say?” “I asked you if you wanted to have dinner in the East Village tomorrow night.” “Okay, I’m going to sign you my answer. Ready?” “Go ahead.” There was a silence, and then he cut in and said, “So that’s a yes, great!” She laughed again. “Let’s meet at the corner of Tenth and First. See you at seven?” “Perfect,” she said.</p>

<p>“Sometimes it’s about what you choose not to read,” she said. “Every book we read or movie we see, every little experience becomes a part of who we are. If we’re all watching the same things and reading the same things and listening to the same things, then our conversations would end up going in circles, reaffirming things we already know and agree about. There would be no surprises, no serendipity. It’d be like this big tragic echo chamber. It’s just not for me. I don’t want to be that hipster girl that lives off the L train, listens to Arcade Fire, and reads Murakami books, you know?”</p>

<p>If there was any sure sign of inexperience, it was believing that everyone had the same motivations.</p>
